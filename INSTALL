Installation of CLCB
====================

A Lisp interpreter is required, tested for compatibility was only
sbcl. Under Debian Linux this is installed by calling

   aptitude install sbcl cl-asdf cl-closer-mop cl-split-sequence \
   			cl-ppcre cl-iterate cl-sql-mysql

For complete functionality, several additional packages 
are required that are no yet availabie in Debian:

alexandria : http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/
moptilies : http://common-lisp.net/project/moptilities/

To install the still missing packages, it is suggested to use
the installer provided by asdf. That process is described at
http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install. From the lisp shell execute

 (require 'asdf)
 (require 'asdf-install)
 (asdf-install:install 'moptilities)

here follow the instructions and once moptilities is installed,
continue with

 (asdf-install:install 'alexandria)

and

 (asdf-install:install 'bind)

If you want to be on the safe side, then also install the gpg keys of
these packages and consider for yourself if you trust them. The keys
needed are

   gpg  --recv-keys 0x9E2F734EF57A448E 0x886A220F86321D48

If there is interest from your side to rebuild the documentation that
is accompaning the source distribution of CLCB, then we suggest to also
install the Debian package

   aptitude install cl-lml2

and back in sbcl:

   (asdf-install:install 'tinaa)

For the startup, some settings are likely to be beneficial to be made
as an initalisation file. Such is constructed by the shell script
'bin/userinit.sh'. When first started, that script's output should be
pasted into the Lisp shell. At the time of writing, the shell, despite
these settings, still is required to be started from the root directory
of CLCB.

For a start it helps to be located in the root directory of CLCB. From there,
execute 

	./bin/userinit.sh

and paste the output to your sbcl shell. If we have not committed some
non-sense the meantime then CLCB should compile smoothly.
